This package provides a logback appender that writes its log events to Cloudwatch.  Before you sat it, there
seem to be many projects like this out there but I could find none of them that were self-contained and that
we published to the central Maven repo.  So here we go reinventing the wheel again...

The git repository is:
	https://github.com/j256/cloudwatch-logback-appender

Maven packages are published via the central repo:
	http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/j256/cloudwatch-logback-appender/cloudwatch-logback-appender/

Enjoy,
