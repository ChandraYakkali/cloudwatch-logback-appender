# Logback log appender for AWS CloudWatch

## Background

This package provides a logback appender that writes its log events to Cloudwatch.  Before you say it,
there seem to be many projects like this out there but I could find none of them that were
self-contained and that we published to the central Maven repo.

The git repository is:
	https://github.com/j256/cloudwatch-logback-appender

Maven packages are published via the central repo: <br />
	http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/j256/cloudwatchlogbackappender/cloudwatchlogbackappender/

## Maven Configuration

``` xml
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.j256.cloudwatchlogbackappender</groupId>
		<artifactId>cloudwatchlogbackappender</artifactId>
		<!-- NOTE: change the version to the most recent release version from the repo -->
		<version>0.2</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## logback.xml Configuration

Minimal logback appender configuration:

``` xml
<appender name="CLOUDWATCH" class="com.j256.cloudwatchlogbackappender.CloudWatchAppender">
	<!-- required settings -->
	<accessKey>XXXXXX</accessKey>
	<secretKey>YYYYYY</secretKey>
	<region>us-east-1</region>
	<logGroup>your-log-group-name-here</logGroup>
	<logStream>your-log-stream-name-here</logStream>
	<!-- possible layout pattern -->
	<layout>
		<pattern>[%thread] %level %logger{20} - %msg</pattern>
	</layout>
</appender>
```

You may want to use our Ec2PatternLayout class which adds support for %instance, %instanceName, %in, %instanceId, and
%iid, then use the following layout stanza.

``` xml
<appender name="CLOUDWATCH" class="com.j256.cloudwatchlogbackappender.CloudWatchAppender">
	...
	<layout class="com.j256.cloudwatchlogbackappender.Ec2PatternLayout">
		<pattern>[%instance] [%thread] %level %logger{20} - %msg</pattern>
	</layout>
```

*NOTE:* If the instance-name is not able to be queried then the instance-id will be used for the name instead.

Here is the complete list of the appender properties.

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `accessKey` | *string* | IAM user access key |
| `secretKey` | *string* | IAM user secret key |
| `region` | *string* | AWS region |
| `logGroup` | *string* | Log group name |
| `logStream` | *string* | Log stream name |
| `maxBatchSize` | *integer* | **Default: 128**<br/>Maximum number of log events put into CloudWatch in single request. |
| `maxBatchTimeMillis` | *integer* | **Default: 5000**<br/>Maximum time in milliseconds to collect log events to submit batch. |
| `maxQueueWaitTimeMillis` | *integer* | **Default: 100**<br/>Maximum time in milliseconds to wait if internal queue is full before dropping log event on the floor. |
| `internalQueueSize` | *integer* | **Default: 8192**<br/>Size of the internal log event queue. |
| `createLogDests` | *boolean* | **Default: true**<br/>Create the CloudWatch log and stream if they don't exist.  Set to **false** to require fewer IAM policy actions. |
| `logExceptions` | *boolean* | **Default: true**<br/>Write exceptions to CloudWatch as log events. |

### Emergency appender

Since this appender is queuing up log events and then writing them remotely, there are a number of situations which
might result in log events not getting remoted correctly.  To protect against this, you can add in an "emergency"
appender to write events to the console or a file by adding the following to your CLOUDWATCH appender stanza:

``` xml
<appender name="CLOUDWATCH" class="com.j256.cloudwatchlogbackappender.CloudWatchAppender">
	...
	<appender-ref ref="EMERGENCY_FILE" />
```

This appender will be used if:

* there was some problem configuring the CloudWatch or other AWS APIs
* the internal queue fills up too fast and messages can't be written remotely fast enough
* there was some problem with the actual put events CloudWatch call â€“ maybe transient network failure

### Required IAM policy

When making any AWS API calls, we typically create a IAM user with specific permissions so if any API keys are stolen,
the hacker only have limited access to our AWS services.  To get the appender to be able to publish to CloudWatch,
the following IAM policy is required to create the log group and put log events to CloudWatch.

The ```logs:CreateLogGroup``` and ```logs:CreateLogStream``` actions are only required if the appender is creating the
log-group and stream itself.  The ```ec2:Describe*``` action is only required if you want the appender to query for the
ec2 instance name it is on.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
                "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
                "logs:PutLogEvents",
                "ec2:Describe*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*",
                "arn:aws:ec2:*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}```
